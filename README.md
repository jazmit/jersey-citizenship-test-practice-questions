This contains some multiple choice practice questions for the Jersey Citizenship Test, the equivalent of the Life in the UK test for the purposes of obtaining indefinite leave to remain (ILR) in Jersey.  The questions here only apply to the supplementary material required for Jersey.

Questions don't yet cover all the material, but should hopefully already be useful for those studying for the exam.  The live multiple choice questions are [here](https://jazmit.github.io/jersey-citizenship-test-practice-questions/)

TODO: 

- [x] Questions on early history
- [x] Basic auto-marking multiple choice interface
- [ ] Questions on late history
- [ ] Questions on Jersey society & law
- [ ] Better multiple choice interface (count score total, etc)
- [ ] Add script to split questions into random tests of 6
- [ ] Nicer CSS for multiple choice questions

Pull requests welcome!  Even if you aren't technical, you can contribute by adding new questions to the file `part_1`.
